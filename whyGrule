Authorization and Access Control: Implement fine-grained access control rules that specify who can access what resources under what conditions.
Fraud Detection: Create rules to identify suspicious activity based on patterns in user behavior or transaction data.
Content Personalization: Tailor content recommendations or user experiences based on user profiles, preferences, and context.
Real-time Decision Making: Make dynamic decisions in real-time based on incoming data streams, such as triggering alerts or adjusting pricing based on market conditions.
